## Project 2 reflection
By Lana Maliavkina



Colour pallet used on the site (light grey, dark grey, gold and white) is in line with my prototype and reflect the style. Gold reflects a historic nature of the site and well as picks up most of the archival images hues and a sun lit concrete. Greys and white reflect the colour of the concrete, the main material of the building and brutalist style.

During my work on the site I faced numerous challenges. Below I have described some of the challenges and the solutions I have found. 

I wanted 2 images appear side by side and I tried a few different codes from different sites including CSS-Tricks. I have successfully adopted the code from w3chools site: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_two_columns_responsive

For quotations marks I adopted a code from css-tricks:

I encounter a problem - the text was cut on the right. I figured out it was because in main style overflow was auto. When I changed it to inherit, the text became all visible.

When I worked on adjusting the layout for different devises the text was visible, but run to the edges of the screen. I experimented with paddings and margins and fixed the problem.

It was tricky to make the footer stay where it belongs. I tried varies resources and used the code from w3schools which seemed to work the best. 

I tried implementing a hamburger menu and I figured out how to make a responsive column. However, altering the main menu have affected my columns. I searched for a solution, but in the end to make the site look elegant and be functional I decided to revert to a reduced scope approach.   

Text and images are resizing gracefully in smaller screen views with the content stays in the middle while margins become narrow in smaller view ports. Only the “Hero” image and the footer are starting to scale down too quickly after 900px wide screen. 

All images are scaled to cater for the size and speed of the site. The biggest image used as a “Hero” is 425kb. Other image are around 150 to 200kb.
