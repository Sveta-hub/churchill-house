I built this website as a learning project for a front-end web course.

Colour pallet used on the site (light grey, dark grey, gold and white) is in line with my prototype and reflect the style. Gold reflects a historic nature of the site and well as picks up most of the archival images hues and a sun lit concrete. Greys and white reflect the colour of the concrete, the main material of the building and brutalist style.

Text and images are resizing gracefully in smaller screen views with the content stays in the middle while margins become narrow in smaller view ports. Only the “Hero” image and the footer are starting to scale down too quickly after 900px wide screen.

All images are scaled to cater for the size and speed of the site. The biggest image used as a “Hero” is 425kb. Other image are around 150 to 200kb.
